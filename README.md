# The Easier Way to Combine Salesforce and Angular

**Notice:** This project was originally forked from Chris Watson's [salesforce-angular2-boilerplate repository](https://github.com/watzon/salesforce-angular2-boilerplate) and updated to work with the latest stable version of Angular (5.2.3 at the time of this writing)

This boilerplate, which is still largely unifinished, combines the powers of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [JSForce](http://jsforce.github.io), [Angular](http://angular.io), and [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) and allows you to develop and test your Salesforce applications completely locally. Deploying is as easy as running `gulp` or you can be more specific and just `gulp deploy:classes`.

### Getting set up

Setting up is super easy. First clone or fork this repository to your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/scottbcovert/angular-salesforce-boilerplate` or, if you forked the repo, do `git clone YOUR-REPO-URL`. Then go to the angular-salesforce-boilerplate directory with `cd angular-salesforce-boilerplate`.

You will need [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org) in order to work with this so make sure you have that installed.

Once you're in the angular-salesforce-boilerplate directory run `npm install`. This project also uses **gulp 4**, so install that:

```
npm rm -g gulp
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

If everything worked `gulp -v` should give you a version number over 4.

You will also need to copy the `config.sample.js` file to `config.js` and fill out the pertenent information. It should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    deploy: {
        username:       'user.name@yourcompany.com',
        password:       'YourPasswordAndPossiblySecurityToken',
        login_url:      'https://login.salesforce.com',
        api_version:    36.0,
        timeout:        120000,
        poll_interval:  5000,
    },

    visualforce: {
        template: 'index.page.html',
        page: 'AngularApp',
        controller: 'AngularAppController'
    },

    resources: {
        app_resource_name: 'AngularApp',
        node_module_resource_name: 'NodeModules',
    },

    options: {
        
    }
}
```

### Running the example

This boilerplate comes with a working example of a **contact management application**. To get it running just run the `gulp` command while in the angular-salesforce-boilerplate directory. It will open a local server at [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) where you should be able to view the working application. When you're ready to deploy the application and test it in Salesforce just run `gulp deploy` and wait for the application to finish deploying.

### File Tree

The way I have structured this project bears describing; whether you are new to Salesforce, Angular, both, or just need some explianation.

#### gulp

The gulp directory contains most of the gulp tasks separated into different files.

+ deploy.js - Contains tasks specific to deployment such as the task that creates the package.xml and the actual jsforce-deploy task.
    - **Tasks**
    - clean-tmp
    - clean-build
    - clean-resources
    - init-deploy
    - tempgen:visualforce
    - tempgen:node_modules
    - tempgen:app
    - tempgen:salesforce
    - tempgen:pxml
    - tempgen:meta-xml
    - package:node_modules
    - package:app
    - package-resources
    - tempgen
    - deploy:jsforce
    - **deploy**
    - **deploy:classes**
+ html.js - Contains the tasks that add template values to the html file and can also turn it into a visualforce page
    - **Tasks**
    - html:dev
    - html:prod
    - visualforce:dev
    - visualforce:prod
    - **watch:html**
+ scripts.js - Contains tasks that compile Typescript and move javascript files to the build directory
    - **Tasks**
    - typescript:dev
    - typescript:prod
    - javascript:dev
    - javascript:prod
    - **scripts:dev**
    - **scripts:prod**
    - **watch:scripts**
+ styles.js - Contains tasks that compile SASS and move css files to the build directory
    - **Tasks**
    - sass:dev
    - sass:prod
    - css:dev
    - css:prod
    - **styles:dev**
    - **styles:prod**
    - **watch:styles**

The main gulp tasks are located in `gulpfile.js` in the root directory. They are:

+ serve - starts the local development server
+ watch:all - Watches scripts, styles, and html and compiles on change
+ default - starts the server and watches files

#### src

The `src` directory contains all of the Source files; Typescript, javascript, sass, html/visualforce, and salesforce specific such as APEX classes.

##### app

The app directory contains all of the Angular files. These are separated into categories such as `components`, `directives`, `pipes`, `resolves`, `services`, and `shared`.

##### salesforce

The salesforce directory is packaged up and deployed with the resource. You can add any Salesforce files you want here such as APEX Classes.

##### styles

Fairly self explanitory the styles directory contains global styles for the app.


Thank you @tylerzika for the suggestion to add this section!

### Contributing

If you find something wrong or come up with a better way to do things please fork and pull request. I check Github several times daily and love seeing that little notification bubble.

### Known Issues

So far things seem to be working well for the most part. Some things that I have noticed are:

+ Visualforce Remoting and WebServices use different date formats. I have tried to compensate for those differences in the Salesforce service with the `parseSoapResult` and `convertDate` methods, but I may have missed an edge case.
